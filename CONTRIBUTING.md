# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

1. Ensure your environment is running Node.js 10+
2. Git clone the [`styled-hooks` repository](https://github.com/colingourlay/styled-hooks).
3. From the root of the repository, run `npm i` to install development dependencies.

## Development

You can develop against the example project by running:

```sh
npm start
```

This will create a build of the example project and watch the `src` and `example` directories for code changes, which will trigger a rebuild.

It will also start a live development server on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), which you can use to view the example app and verify your changes.

## Building

You can build the project by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

The build process uses [`microbundle`](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) to create two artifacts from the `src/styled-hooks.js` entry point:

- `dist/styled-hooks.js` for `require()`-ing with CommonJS
- `dist/styled-hooks.m.js` for `import`-ing as an ECMAScript Module
